<h1>Fast Synthesis of Power and Temperature Profiles for the Development of
Data-Driven Resource Managers</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The page concerns the following work:
<ul>
<li>I. Ukhov, D. Marculescu, P. Eles, and Z. Peng. <em>Fast synthesis of power
and temperature profiles for the development of data-driven resource
managers</em>. Tech. rep. Link&ouml;ping University, Sept. 2017.
</ul>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>The implementation is open source. It is written in the <a
href='https://www.rust-lang.org'>Rust</a> programming language, and the
corresponding source code is available on <a
href='https://github.com'>GitHub</a>. More concretely, the code is split between
three organizations:

<ul>
<li><a href='https://github.com/stainless-steel'>Stainless Steel</a>, which
contains libraries of general interest,

<li><a href='https://github.com/markov-chain'>Markov Chain</a>, which
contains libraries specific to this work, and

<li><a href='https://github.com/learning-on-chip'>Learning on Chip</a>, which
contains another set of libraries specific to this work.
</ul>

<h3>Stainless Steel</h3>
<p>The organization provides libraries for such interrelated disciplines as
linear algebra, statistics, probability theory, and numerical analysis.

<h3>Markov Chain</h3>
<p>The organization provides libraries for simulating timing-, power-, and
temperature-related characteristics of computer systems.

<p>The highlights of the organization are:
<ul>
<li><a href='https://github.com/markov-chain/fractal'>fractal</a>, a multiscale
modeling framework, and

<li><a href='https://github.com/markov-chain/temperature'>temperature</a>, a
temperature simulator.
</ul>

<h3>Learning on Chip</h3>
<p>The organization provides the tools and infrastructures described in the
paper.

<p>The highlights of the organization are:
<ul>
<li><a href='https://github.com/learning-on-chip/recorder'>recorder</a>, a tool
for recording workload patterns,

<li><a href='https://github.com/learning-on-chip/streamer'>streamer</a>, a tool
for generating on-chip data,

<li><a href='https://github.com/learning-on-chip/planner'>planner</a>, a tool
for constructing floorplans,

<li><a href='https://github.com/learning-on-chip/studio'>studio</a>, an
infrastructure for recording workload patterns,

<li><a
href='https://github.com/learning-on-chip/station'>station</a>, an
infrastructure for generating on-chip data,

<li><a
href='https://github.com/learning-on-chip/reference-traffic'>reference-traffic</a>,
reference traffic patterns, and

<li><a
href='https://github.com/learning-on-chip/reference-workload'>reference-workload</a>,
reference workload patterns.
</ul>
