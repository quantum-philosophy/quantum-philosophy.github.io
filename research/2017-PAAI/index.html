<h1>Probabilistic Analysis of Electronic Systems via Adaptive Hierarchical
Interpolation</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The page concerns the following work:
<ul>
<li>I. Ukhov, P. Eles, and Z. Peng. &ldquo;Probabilistic analysis of electronic
systems via adaptive hierarchical interpolation.&rdquo; In: <em>IEEE
Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems</em>
36.11 (Nov. 2017), pp. 1883â€“1896.
</ul>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>The implementation is open source. It is written in the
<a href='https://golang.org/'>Go</a> programming language, and the corresponding
source code is available on <a href='https://github.com'>GitHub</a>. More
concretely, the code is split between two organizations:

<ul>
<li><a href='https://github.com/ready-steady'>Ready Steady</a>, which contains
libraries of general interest, and

<li><a href='https://github.com/turing-complete'>Turing Complete</a>, which
contains libraries specific to this work.
</ul>

<h3>Ready Steady</h3>
<p>The organization provides libraries for such interrelated disciplines as
linear algebra, statistics, probability theory, and numerical analysis. In
particular, it contains an implementation of the adaptive interpolation
algorithm described in the paper.

<p>The highlights of the organization are:
<ul>
<li><a href='https://github.com/ready-steady/adapt'>adapt</a>, the adaptive
interpolation algorithm.
</ul>

<h3>Turing Complete</h3>
<p>The organization provides libraries for simulating timing-, power-, and
temperature-related characteristics of multiprocessor platforms executing
applications given as directed acyclic graphs. It also contains the experimental
setup described in the paper.

<p>The highlights of the organization are:
<ul>
<li><a href='https://github.com/turing-complete/laboratory'>laboratory</a>, the
synthetic examples,

<li><a href='https://github.com/turing-complete/application'>application</a>,
the real-life example, and

<li><a href='https://github.com/turing-complete/environment'>environment</a>,
the environment for running the real-life example.
</ul>
