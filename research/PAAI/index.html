<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The page concerns the following work under submission:
<ul>
<li>I. Ukhov, P. Eles, and Z. Peng, &ldquo;Probabilistic analysis of electronic
systems via adaptive hierarchical interpolation.&rdquo;
</ul>

<h1>Implementation</h1>
<p>The implementation is open source. It is written in <a
href='https://golang.org/'>Go</a>, and the corresponding source code is
available on <a href='https://github.com'>GitHub</a>. Specifically, the code is
split between two organizations:

<ul>
<li><a href='https://github.com/ready-steady'>Ready Steady</a>, which contains
codes of general interest, and

<li><a href='https://github.com/turing-complete'>Turing Complete</a>, which
contains codes specific to simulation of electronic systems.
</ul>

<h2>Ready Steady</h2>
<p>The organization deals with such interrelated disciplines as linear algebra,
statistics, probability theory, and numerical analysis. In particular, it
contains an implementation of the adaptive interpolation algorithm described in
the paper.

<p>The highlights of the organization:
<ul>
<li><a href='https://github.com/ready-steady/adapt'>adapt</a> &mdash; the
adaptive interpolation algorithm.
</ul>

<h2>Turing Complete</h2>
<p>The organization deals with the simulation of timing-, power-, and
temperature-related characteristics of multiprocessor platforms executing
applications given as directed acyclic task graphs. It also contains the
experimental setup described in the paper.

<p>The highlights of the organization:
<ul>
<li><a href='https://github.com/turing-complete/laboratory'>laboratory</a>
&mdash; the experimental setup.
</ul>
