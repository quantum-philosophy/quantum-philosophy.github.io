<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The page concerns the following work under submission:
<ul>
<li>I. Ukhov, P. Eles, and Z. Peng, &ldquo;Probabilistic analysis of electronic
systems via adaptive hierarchical interpolation.&rdquo;
</ul>

<h1>Implementation</h1>
<p>The implementation is open source. It is written in <a
href='https://golang.org/'>Go</a>, and the corresponding source code is
available on <a href='https://github.com'>GitHub</a>. More concretely, the code
is split between two organizations:

<ul>
<li><a href='https://github.com/ready-steady'>Ready Steady</a>, which contains
libraries of general interest, and

<li><a href='https://github.com/turing-complete'>Turing Complete</a>, which
contains libraries specific to system simulation.
</ul>

<h2>Ready Steady</h2>
<p>The organization provides libraries for such interrelated disciplines as
linear algebra, statistics, probability theory, and numerical analysis. In
particular, it contains an implementation of the adaptive interpolation
algorithm described in the paper.

<p>The highlights of the organization:
<ul>
<li><a href='https://github.com/ready-steady/adapt'>adapt</a> &mdash; the
adaptive interpolation algorithm.
</ul>

<h2>Turing Complete</h2>
<p>The organization provides libraries for the simulation of timing-, power-,
and temperature-related characteristics of multiprocessor platforms executing
applications given as directed acyclic graphs. It also contains the experimental
setup described in the paper.

<p>The highlights of the organization:
<ul>
<li><a href='https://github.com/turing-complete/laboratory'>laboratory</a>
&mdash; the experimental setup.
</ul>
